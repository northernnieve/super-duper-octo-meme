A set of all assignments in cse142

This is exactly what it sounds like: a set of all assignments made for CSE142.
If anyone runs into this, congratulations and my condolences. These are all the assignments that I've done as of Spring 2019
I don't know if the dude will reuse any of the new assignments. This is made for the sake of my teaching portfolio.

Inside are comments made by yours truly. Good luck.
