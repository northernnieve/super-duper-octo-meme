A set of all assignments in cse142.

This is exactly what it sounds like: git repository to store my University of Washington CSE142 homework solutions.

If anyone runs into this through the internet, congratulations and my condolences. These are all the assignments that I've done as of Spring 2019.
I don't know if the dude will reuse any of the new assignments. This is made for the sake of my teaching portfolio.

Inside are comments made by yours truly. Good luck.
