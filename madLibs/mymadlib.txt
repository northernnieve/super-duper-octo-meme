You know <city> , <country> ? In English, they pronounce it like " <plural-noun> ," 
but everyone else <verb> it without the "s" sound, like the French do. 
But with <city> , everyone it says it the <language> way, " <city> ." 
None of this makes sense if you really think about it, it surpasses the rules of Linguistics.
Like The Merchant of <adjective> and Death in <adjective> . . . Why though?! 
Why isn't the title <job-title> in Venezia?! Are you mocking me?! 
It takes place in <country> so use the <language> word, darn it! 
That <noun> turns me off! Bunch of <noun> !
